                <p>Macaroni and cheese, commonly known as mac & cheese, is a comfort food staple that has captured the
                    hearts of people all over the world. Originating from Europe and popularized in the United States,
                    this
                    dish consists of elbow macaroni pasta smothered in a creamy cheese sauce. The simplicity of its
                    ingredients—pasta, cheese, and often a touch of butter or milk—belies a rich, complex flavor that
                    has
                    made it a favorite for both quick weeknight dinners and festive holiday gatherings.</p>

            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375°. Grease a 13"x9" baking dish with butter. In a large pot of boiling salted
                    water, cook macaroni, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 1 stick butter. Sprinkle flour over and cook, stirring,
                    until slightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in milk and whisk until combined. Add mustard powder;
                    season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until sauce
                    starts to thicken, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove pan from heat and whisk in cheddar, Gruyère, and 1 cup Parmesan until melted and smooth. Stir
                    in macaroni and transfer to the prepared dish.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine panko, oil, and remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Sprinkle over macaroni; season
                    with more pepper.</li>
                <li>Bake mac and cheese until bubbly and golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
