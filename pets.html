            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width="400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

            <h2>Pluto</h2>
            <img src="images/pluto.jpg" width="400" alt="Little white dog with curly hair">

            <p>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken to the
                Valley Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special
                personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the window to
                keep watch of his house. Don't let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the
                mailman and squirrels every single day.</p>
            <p>Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Plutos favorite part of the day is
                his daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy
                duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so he makes sure to get some
                practice with his toy duck.</p>

            <p>Loves chasings tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Often found sitting by the fire in
                wintertime, and in sun patches when available. He’s energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves
                people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long.</p>
            <p>Loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He
                especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn’t get a snack. </P>

            <h2>Sage the Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/sage_classic.jpeg" width="400" alt="A happy golden retriever is sitting on a bed">

            <p>Sage is a 3 year old Golden Retriever. She is one of the laziest dogs. She loves sneaking into the
                bedroom and hopping onto the neatest bed. She also loves riding in a car with the windows open feeling
                the wind and air. She enjoys walking, only if you take her for a ride to a big arboretum or park.
                Walking around the neighborhood is not necessarily her cup of tea.</p>
            <p>Her favorite food is corn. One day, she stole corn on the cob from the dining table, which was surprising
                because she is normally gentle and polite. She took the stolen corn to the patio and enjoyed her meal by
                herself. Unfortunately, the corn turned out to be unripe, so she ended up vomiting it all later.</p>
